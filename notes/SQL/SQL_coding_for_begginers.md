There are four groups of features that most of DBMS currently offer:
 - Data Definition
 - Update
 - Retrieval
 - Management - User registration and security stuff

A **database system** is made by a *database (storage)*, a *DBMS* which are in accordance with some *model database*.

A **database server** is a computer wich only run DBMS and some other relaterd softwares which the primary job is to hold real databases.

Databases and DBMS can have some parameters like:
- supported database models (relational or XML)
- how much computers can operate than (like clusters)
- query language (SQL or XQuery)
- internal engineering

Here we will focus on **relational databases**. This type of database consist of a "collection of tables" that can be matched to a predetermined category and each table has at least one data category in a column and each row has a certain data instance.
